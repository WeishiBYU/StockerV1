## Elevator Pitch

Everyone and their uncle has thought about making a stock predictor to do day trading (They never work!). What you need instead is to have an easy service that will help you know what the companies of your choice is doing right now. Stocker is here to help you by using AI to analyze the most popular news sources for you so you can always be informed. Stocker, spend more time investing and less time reading!

## Key Features

- Over 10 top news sources supported
- Get summaries of what your companies are doing right now
- Get information in realtime
- Use AI to ask questions about your companies
- Login to save stocks to your watch list

## Technologies
I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- HTML - Basic structural and organizational elements.
- CSS - Styling and animating.
- React - Componentization, routing, and user reactivity using the React framework and JavaScript.
- Web service - Endpoints provided by your backend service that support authentication and application specific functionality.
- Database: Store authentication and application data.
- WebSocket: Realtime information pushed from your backend to your frontend.
