# StockerV1
This is a web application that will use AI to give information about stocks of your choice. 

[Notes](notes.md)

## Elevator Pitch

Everyone and their uncle has thought about making a stock predictor to do day trading (They never work!). What you need instead is to have an easy service that will help you know what the companies of your choice is doing right now. Stocker is here to help you by using AI to analyze the most popular news sources for you so you can always be informed. Stocker, spend more time investing and less time reading!

## Design

## Technologies
I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Correct use of HTML for structure of 3 pages. (Homepage, Stocks Browsing, Personal Stocks)
- **CSS** - Styling each page to look good on different aspect ratios and colors.
- **React** - Using JS to allow for login, searching, and bookmarking of stocks.
- **Web service** - Endpoints for:
    - Login
    - Adding Bookmarks
    - Retrieving Stocks
    - AI Api
    - New Apis
- **Database**: Store logins, user stock bookmarks, news information, and stock information securely in database.
- **WebSocket**: As an user logs in, real time data is displayed for each stock and news information.


## Deployment
=======
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
